The thing you should focus is 
1. Some thing I always didn't know now is easy to know without figure
2. Some thing I can't do well now is easy for me
3. And how to make the things you do better

Instead focus on 
1. I am good person or not? Can I do it well? 
2. Could that stupid test really mean something?
3. I can't know what am I and other people knows about it?

That thing in this land is like prediction, and I am truely a person who do not belive that.
